      <p class="create">Do your best work with a powerful macOS app packed with all the tools you need for a truly collaborative design process.</p>


<h1>Flexible Design</h1>
<p class="par">Pushing your boundaries means bending without breaking. To apply that to your work you need a robust set of design tools. Sketch has your whole design process covered, from canvas to code.</p>

    <div class="clearfix">

      <img src="images/app2.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="App Development">


      <h4>Landmark vector editing</h4>
      <p>
        Sketch started life as a revolutionary vector editing tool. Those tools for editing vectors and boolean operations are more
        intuitive and flexible than ever thanks to features like shorthand math operators and easy editing for multiple borders.
        Iterate on your work with ease at any stage of the design process.
      </p>
      <h4>A Canvas without limits</h4>
      <p>
        When your Canvas is infinite, so are the possibilities. Especially with simple resizing tools to fit any screen size.
        Don’t worry about blank page syndrome here though, flexible Artboards and Templates give you great foundations to stay
        organized and find your flow.
      </p>
      <h4>Variable and OpenType fonts</h4>
      <p>
        SMake typography follow your instructions to the letter with variable fonts and RTL support, and unlock alternate characters,
        ligatures and more with full support for OpenType features.
      </p>
      <h4>Design System control</h4>
      <p>
        Build a Design System that works for you with Symbols, Colors and Styles. Then manage, browse and organize everything in one
        place with Components View. Inserting is super-fast too, thanks to searchable menus and a dedicated Insert Window.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Consitent Design</h1>
    <p class="par">Projects move fast. Deadlines exist. Time is precious. Cut out unnecessary legwork and deliver quality without setbacks.</p>

        <div class="clearfix">

          <img src="images/app3.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="App Development">


          <h4>Start with Artboard Templates</h4>
          <p>
            Don’t redesign the wheel. Turn any Artboard – and its content – into a template
            and reuse it across your documents. Include your Artboard Templates as part of a Library to make them available for other
            documents.
          </p>
          <h4>Set the bar with Symbols</h4>
          <p>
            With responsive Symbols, create a component once, reuse it anywhere, and update every instance simultaneously.
            Symbols can even automatically resize to fit their content with Smart Layout, keeping the spacing of the layers in your
            Symbols intact.
          </p>
          <h4>Stay in sync with Styles</h4>
          <p>
            Define Color Variables, Text and Layer Styles that work for you. Then use, reuse
            and update them across your designs. With Color Tokens you can even export, integrate and sync Color Variables to development
            projects.
          </p>
          <h4>Test fast with Prototypes</h4>
          <p>
            Build user journeys in no time at all with Prototyping tools built for speed. Reusable UI elements,
            powerful Overlays and a dedicated Prototyping UI means you can bring life to your ideas and share
            them with the world – quickly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Design that grows with you</h1>
        <p class="par">As a designer, you’re always evolving. Use tools that allow your work and workflow to evolve with you.
          With Sketch your documents are futureproofed for any eventuality – be that style changes, team changes, or even
          software changes.</p>

            <div class="clearfix">

              <img src="images/app4.jpg" class="col-md-6 float-md-end mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="App Development">


              <h4>Build reliable Libraries</h4>
              <p>
                Create Libraries of your Symbols, Text Styles, Layer Styles, and Color Variables. Share
                them across documents and with collaborators automatically, and push updates that keep everyone in sync as your
                Design System evolves.
              </p>
              <h4>Design together</h4>
              <p>
                With real-time collaboration in the Mac app, and a set of cross-platform
                tools for feedback, sharing and developer handoff in the browser, you can keep everyone on the same page (literally).
              </p>
              <h4>Take your files anywhere</h4>
              <p>
                With Sketch, you own everything you create. It’s up to you what happens with your documents, because our file format is
                completely open so third-party tools can read and modify it. You can even automate actions in your Sketch documents without
                plugins — without Sketch, even.
              </p>
              <h4>Online or offline</h4>
              <p>
                Sketch doesn’t force you to have an internet connection to do your design work. Create new documents, keep existing projects moving and
                even access Libraries at any time. Whether you’re going through a tunnel, a power surge, or a detox from the newsfeed,
                Sketch still works.
